# Battery for CUDA programming

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lattice-land/cuda-battery.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/lattice-land/cuda-battery)

This library provides a number of data structures to ease the programming in CUDA (version 12 or higher).
Our goal is to support the development of various lattice data structures in our project "Lattice Land".

Information are available in the [book](https://lattice-land.github.io/CUDA-Battery.html).
