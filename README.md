# Battery for CUDA programming

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lattice-land/cuda-battery.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/lattice-land/cuda-battery)

This library provides a number of data structures to ease the programming in CUDA.
Our goal is to support the development of various lattice data structures in our project "Lattice Land".
